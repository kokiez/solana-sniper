# Solana Sniper Bot

The Solana Sniper is a powerful Python-based tool designed to automate the process of buying and selling coins on the Solana blockchain. It allows you to set stop loss and limit orders, enabling you to execute trades automatically based on your predefined criteria. The sniper will snipe tokens from telegram channels based on CA or a birdeye url. Raydium has been added too because Jupiter does not support low liquidity coins.

## Requirements

To use the Solana Sniper, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- A Solana wallet with sufficient funds for trading and must have the private key in the form of alphanumeric string.
- Access to Telegram channels for receiving trade signals.
- Discord Webhook urls.
- Telegram bot api keys.
- Solana RPC Provider's HTTPS URL
